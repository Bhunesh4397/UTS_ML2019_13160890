        "**Content**\n",
        "    \n",
        "The main concept of proposing Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) is to estimate number of generative model and their framework using adversarial network process. Generative adversarial network model represents the probability distribution of actual data that encountered from artificial intelligence algorithms. This model is advance version of generative models which can defines whether the data samples are from data distribution or model distribution. GAN model is able to create data points after learning from actual data distribution which is called discriminative model. This model also can able to predict the actual source of data distribution. The important goal of generating GAN is to reduce the ratio of incorrect prediction in discriminative model where actual data points are more close to the artificial data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "The special case that explored in this paper is when the sample generated by generative model passed random noise over the multilayer perceptron at same time the discriminative model also works as multilayer perceptron. The only way to train both the model using dropout algorithms, high successful backpropagation and sample of generative model by using forward propagation. There has been issues of Generative Adversarial Network with prevailing generative models, however the main noticeable issue is the intractability in some calculation of probability which is necessary in Markov chains. Generative Adversarial Network can solve this concern as this model does not made any assumption about probability distribution of data and model, instead of that this model learns from discriminative model and generative model and then prepares the training dataset. \n",

        "**Innovation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper contributes to a new algorithms for developing generative models and able to overcome previous limitations of previous generative models. E.g. needing Markov chains for sampling, needing approximations for calculating actual distribution p(x) since it is intractable [1]. The technique can be applied to the same situations that previous generative models could be applied to. The paper does provide the groundwork for future innovations in the field. With GANs being a new method (at the time of publishing), there is plenty of exploration that can be done with GANs. Deep fakes are evidence of GANs being more than just a niche algorithm with limited applicability.\n",
        "  \n",
        "The research on GANs in the paper is extremely innovative for a multitude of reasons. The first reason is that GANs are able to overcome many of the limitations of other models. Previous generative models such as Deep Directed/Undirected Graphical Models were unable to calculate p(x), the probability distribution for the dataset. These models would need to rely on approximation methods to provide an estimate of p(x), which would hinder the quality of the training provided to the generative model. GANs do not need a representation of p(x) to be trained as the model is trained by a discriminative model instead. Previous generative models also relied on Markov chains to sample from the training data, which was computationally expensive. GANs reduce the computational power required for sampling by utilizing forward propagation, a feature of neural networks where an input passed through the network which, in the case of GANs is usually random noise, will be transformed into output by the nodes of the network. These computational advantages make GANs innovative as they expand the realm of possible problems that GANs can solve.\n",

        "**Technical quality**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the paper had higher level of technical quality. The basic theoretical features of GANs were described in a detail form and supported by proofs, pseudocode and mathematical equations that allows the other researcher to explore their potential areas and flows of GANs for improvement. However the author of paper does not described the detailed idea of how deep experiments are taken place but they gives the github link which can describes in detail about how experiments are taken place. These links are very useful to validate the replicability and reliability of achieved results.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are still several issues that affects the technical features of paper. Out of them the main issue is least amount of experiment conducted by researchers upon this model. In this paper the author only use three other generative model to compare and only 2 experiments were conducted. These might be arise question upon reliability of the experimental results and especially about evaluation method which can estimates the result by using log-likelihood and maps high variance. The quantitative evaluation is a only source to provide probability distribution which is not much useful in a quantitative evaluation. But author mention that the main purpose of qualitative evaluation is to demonstrate GANs model which is bare minimum, and competitive with current generative model but it does not provide comparison. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Application And X-Factor**\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors do not discuss the application domain of GANs. However, it can be assumed that the application domain is no different from that of other generative models. Generative models are primarily useful for any problem in which data points, rather than predictions, must be outputted from the model, with the 'data points' representing images. Already GANs have proven their usefulness when applied to this set of problems. A rather infamous application of GANs is Deep Fakes, where convincing videos of celebrities were created and uploaded online. The amount of media attention generated by Deep is testament to the suitability of GANs for generating images or sequences of images. Deep Fakes have not only brought to light the power of GANs but also highlighted the potential for GANs to be used maliciously.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs could also potentially be used for more artistic purposes. Since GANs have the ability to generate images that are in some way similar to training images, new pieces of art could be created that is based on a particular artstyle or even a combination of artstyles. In fact,the paper were able to demonstrate the ability of GANs to create facial images of anime characters. These images could also be used to provide inspiration to an artist, especially in cases where the generated images may not be of high quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple directions that future research can take in order to further develop GANs. Future works could conduct research from an optimization perspective, where the research is focused on achieving performance increases. The authors have suggested that efficiency can be increased through the development of better methods for training the generative and discriminative model as well as better methods for sampling from the distribution. Further research could also develop variants of GANs such as conditional GANs, which add an extra input to the generative model such as a class label. \n",

        "**Presentation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The presentation of the paper is of a high standard of quality. The introduction and abstract provide a clear overview of what the paper is about without bombarding the reader with too much detail. The body of the paper contains plenty of depth and does not waste time discussing irrelevant points. Appropriate formatting is used for mathematical equations and pseudocode, and diagrams and graphs are provided in order to present a clearer view of certain concepts. The language used throughout the paper avoids being overly verbose. The only area that was lacking with regards to the presentation of the paper was the little explanation provided on the setup of the experiments, which leaves the reader confused about how they might replicate the experiment. Although there is a link to the source code, this link is provided in a small font at the footer of the first page which makes it easy to miss and there is no further mention of it throughout the paper.\n",
