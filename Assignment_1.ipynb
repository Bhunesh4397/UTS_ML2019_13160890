        "The main concept of proposing Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) is to estimate number of generative model and their framework using adversarial network process. Generative adversarial network model represents the probability distribution of actual data that encountered from artificial intelligence algorithms. This model is advance version of generative models which can defines whether the data samples are from data distribution or model distribution. GAN model is able to create data points after learning from actual data distribution which is called discriminative model. This model also can able to predict the actual source of data distribution. The important goal of generating GAN is to reduce the ratio of incorrect prediction in discriminative model where actual data points are more close to the artificial data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "The special case that explored in this paper is when the sample generated by generative model passed random noise over the multilayer perceptron at same time the discriminative model also works as multilayer perceptron. The only way to train both the model using dropout algorithms, high successful backpropagation and sample of generative model by using forward propagation. There has been issues of Generative Adversarial Network with prevailing generative models, however the main noticeable issue is the intractability in some calculation of probability which is necessary in Markov chains. Generative Adversarial Network can solve this concern as this model does not made any assumption about probability distribution of data and model, instead of that this model learns from discriminative model and generative model and then prepares the training dataset. \n",

        "**Innovation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper mainly contains a various algorithms to develop generative models which are able to overcome limitations of previous generative model. For example Markov chains needed for sampling. Needed approximation in actual calculation of probability distribution because it’s interactive behaviour. This paper provides the basic groundwork of future innovations that could implement in same field and also there are so many explorations can be produce with GANs. For example Deep fakes is a main evidence of this model. \n",
        "\n",
        "The research taken place on GAN is exceptionally innovative for a various reasons. The foremost reason of that is GAN is able to overcome the limitations of previously developed models. Traditional generative models like deep directed or undirected graphical model was not able to calculate precise probability distribution of dataset and this model mostly rely on approximation algorithm that calculates the estimate probability of dataset, which might the delay the quality of training dataset provided by generative model. While in GAN there is no need to represent probability of training data instead of that this model uses discriminative model as training model. Traditional generative models are also depends on Markov chains samples of training data which is expensive. But GAN reduce the required computational power for sampling through utilizing the forward propagation technique. Neural network is also one of advantage of GANs in which input data pass through trained network, so generated noise will directly transformed into output. These advantages makes GAN more innovative and adaptive. \n",

        "**Technical quality**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the paper had higher level of technical quality. The basic theoretical features of GANs were described in a detail form and supported by proofs, pseudocode and mathematical equations that allows the other researcher to explore their potential areas and flows of GANs for improvement. However the author of paper does not described the detailed idea of how deep experiments are taken place but they gives the github link which can describes in detail about how experiments are taken place. These links are very useful to validate the replicability and reliability of achieved results.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are still several issues that affects the technical features of paper. Out of them the main issue is least amount of experiment conducted by researchers upon this model. In this paper the author only use three other generative model to compare and only 2 experiments were conducted. These might be arise question upon reliability of the experimental results and especially about evaluation method which can estimates the result by using log-likelihood and maps high variance. The quantitative evaluation is a only source to provide probability distribution which is not much useful in a quantitative evaluation. But author mention that the main purpose of qualitative evaluation is to demonstrate GANs model which is bare minimum, and competitive with current generative model but it does not provide comparison. \n",

        "**Application And X-Factor**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this paper, the authors does not describe the application domain of GANs. But it can assumed that the domain of application is not more different from the generative models. GANs are the primary useful models for any data point’s problem, while predictions are must be output from generative model with various data points that represents in image format. GANs have already proven the usefulness when it applies to this kind of problems. Deepfake is a example of GANs application in which fake video and audio of celebrities are created and uploaded it online. Deepfake creates huge amount of attention for GANs for generating sequence of images. It highlights the potential of GANs.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs can also be used potentially for more creative purpose. Since this model have ability to create images or sequence of images similar to the training data that create new art on particular artstyle. The paper also able to determine the ability of GANs to create different facial image and other characters. These pictures are also useful for artist to get inspiration.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are numerous directions to explore research that helps to develop GANs more efficient in future. This work could be conduct research on optimization perspective in which the research mainly focus on how to improve performance of model. In this paper authors have proposed the better methods to increase efficiency to train discriminative and generative model and also simplified algorithms for sampling the data distributions. Moreover, the research can also developed the conditional GANs model which can adds the extra input in generative model as extra label.\n",

        "\n",
        "The paper is presented in a high standard quality. In beginning of the paper the abstract and introduction provides a clear objective about topic described in paper without going in detailed theory. The body paragraph of this paper have plenty of detailed information with facts and mathematical algorithms about GANs model. The body of the paper also contain the some examples, innovativeness of this model, required tools and technology, and advantages and disadvantages of this model. In this paper author also use the proper formatting for pseudocode, equations and diagrams which represents the clear view of GANs model. Overall author used appropriate language and avoids verbose. The paper has only lacking area with respects to the presentation is about provided explanation of experiments about how it is replicated which creates confusion in readers mind. However they provides the link of source code which makes experiment understandable to the readers.\n",
